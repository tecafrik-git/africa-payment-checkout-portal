# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the payment portal's phone number input field by integrating the intl-tel-input JavaScript library. The enhancement will provide users with a more intuitive and user-friendly phone number entry experience, including automatic country detection, international format support, visual country flags, and validation. The default country will be set to Senegal (SN) to match the primary target market, while still allowing users to select any country from the dropdown.
